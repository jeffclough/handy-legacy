These are home-grown commands and Python modules that make me more efficient (or at least happier).

Externals:
To update external projects, run "git submodule update --init --recursive".

## Installation:

Run `./install` to install these the way I do or run `./install -h` for other options. By default, the directory structure below will be created and used in the conventional ways.

```
~/my/
~/my/bin/
~/my/etc/
~/my/include/
~/my/lib/
~/my/lib/python
```

Add to PATH and PYTHONPATH in your profile as needed.

```shell
export PATH=~/my/bin;$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=~/my/lib/python;$PYTHONPATH
```
