# Warning!
This code is currently in a transitional state between Python 2 and Python 3. I'm porting it to 3 as I have time. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

# handy
These are home-grown commands and Python modules that make me more efficient (or at least happier).

Externals:
To update external projects, run "git submodule update --init --recursive".

Installation:
Run "./install" to install these the way I do or "./install -h" for other options.
